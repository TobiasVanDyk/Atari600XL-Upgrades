SIO2PC is a hardware & software package interfacing the 8-bit Atari to PC compatible computers. The original idea was to have the PC emulate Atari disk drives so Atari programs could be stored on the PC's hard (or floppy) drives. A hardware device to convert logic levels was also necessary. This device is now commonly referred to as an SIO2PC cable.
