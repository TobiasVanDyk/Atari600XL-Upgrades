Here's the pin-out of a couple of important connectors:

1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9

Above is the view of a DB-9F connector, which is what plugs into the serial port of your PC. This is the rear view, so it's looking at the back of the connector, where you'd solder your wires. This also makes it the front view of the connector on your PC. Sorry I couldn't indent the second row and make it look more like the actual layout, but html is html. Anyway, the pin assignments are:

PC serial port connector (DB-9) pins used by SIO2PC:

2 data in (to the PC)
3 data out (to Atari, modem or whatever)
9 RI (ring indicator), which is an input to the PC that I use for the command line
7 RTS (request to send) an output from the PC I use with 1050-2-PC
5 Ground

Not used by SIO2PC:

8 CTS (clear to send) is an input to the PC
1 CD (carrier detect) is an input to the PC
6 DSR (data set ready) is an input to the PC
4 DTR (data terminal ready) is an output from the PC

SIO connector on the Atari:

2 4 6 8 10 12

1 3 5 7 9 11 13

Above is the view looking into the connector on the Atari computer or peripheral.

Note that the Atari hardware has stuff designed into this port that was never used by the OS. 
The clocks, for example. Also note that some of the lines are connected to POKEY and some to the PIA chips. 
You need the Technical Reference Notes if you want to get into all of this weirdness. 
Also, I've seen some debates about the mysterious differences between the two ground pins, 
but I'm pretty sure on my old '800's motherboard they're both soldered to the same circuit board pad.
